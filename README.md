# Random Password Generator

Generate strong, secure passwords right from your terminal using Python! This lightweight tool lets users customize:

* **Password length**
* Inclusion of **letters** (upper & lower case)
* Inclusion of **numbers**
* Inclusion of **symbols**

# Key Concepts & Challenges

1. **Randomization**
   Use Python’s `random` and character sets from `string` to create unpredictable, unique passwords ([geeksforgeeks.org][1], [dev.to][2], [github.com][3], [keepersecurity.com][4]).

2. **User Input Validation**
   Ensure users input a sensible length and select at least one character type.

3. **Character Set Handling**
   Dynamically build the pool based on selections—letters, digits, symbols—for maximum flexibility and security.

4. **Security Awareness**
   Encourage best practices:

   * Longer passwords (12+ characters) are more secure ([ssh.com][5])
   * Combining character types strengthens entropy ([dev.to][2])
   * Avoid personal info and predictable patterns ([hypervault.com][6])
